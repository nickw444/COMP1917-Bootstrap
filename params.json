Over the years, I've seen some interesting things COMP1917 students do to program on their own computers, which only makes the development process really hard. These include:\r\n\r\n - Editing code on your local machine, uploading code to CSE servers, compiling and running on CSE servers.\r\n - Editing code on CSE servers using Nano, compiling on CSE servers, running on CSE servers. \r\n - Editing code on a Windows or OSX machine in a GUI Text Editor, drag and dropping files into a Ubuntu virtual machine, compiling within\r\n\r\nThere are many more weird things I've seen people do, none of which are required.\r\n\r\n## Introducing Vagrant\r\nVagrant is a tool which takes care of provisioning virtual machines. Vagrant is able to create a virtual machine, share folders between the host, and provide easy ways to connect to it. \r\n\r\nThis repository has the following goals:\r\n\r\n- Setup a headless virtual machine (Ubuntu 15)\r\n- Shares the folder \"./work\" into the directories ~/ and /work\r\n- Installs commonly used tools, including gcc, gdb and valgrind.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nYou only need to follow these steps once for every computer you work on. \r\n\r\n### 1. Install Virtualbox on your computer.\r\n[Download and install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) on your computer. \r\nVagrant uses Virtualbox as the backend hypervisor. \r\n\r\n### 2. Install Vagrant on your computer\r\nHead on over to the [Vagrant downloads page](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and \r\npick up the latest copy of Vagrant. \r\n\r\n### 3. There is no step 3. You're done. Continue onto the \"Using Vagrant\" section\r\n\r\n## Using Vagrant\r\n### 1. Power on the Machine\r\nOpen a terminal. Type:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd <path/to/the/directory/of/this/repository>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must replace the `<path/to/the/directory...` with the path where you downloaded \r\nthis repository to. \r\n\r\nType:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is the first time `vagrant up` is being run, it may take a bit longer, because it's performing\r\nsome machine provisioning.\r\n\r\nNote: You only need to perform `vagrant up` if you have restarted your computer, or explicitly ran \r\n`vagrant destroy` or `vagrant halt`. \r\n\r\n### 2. Connect to the machine\r\nIn the same terminal, type\r\n\r\n```\r\nvagrant ssh\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou now have an open terminal session within the vagrant machine. Any work you perform in the folder /work \r\nor your home directory should by synced to your local machine.\r\n\r\nIt might even be worthwhile syncing the \"./work\" directory on your host with dropbox if you have multiple computers.\r\n\r\n## Using Vagrant Video!\r\nComing Soon!\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n#### I need the IP address of the machine. How do I do that?\r\n#### I want root access, how do I do that?","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
